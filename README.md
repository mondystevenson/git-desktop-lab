# git-desktop-lab

Lab4 is for practicing using Git (GitHub and GitHub Desktop)for version control, collaboration, conflict resolution.

I cloned the browser repository on my desktop.

I added an info.text file with my id and name. I commited both the info file and this readme file to my clone branch and then published the branch and it looks like it worked!!!!! 

I created a new branch in GitHub desktop called feature/new-content. I commited to it a file content.txt. Then I (published) pushed. Went to GitHub to create a pull request. I merged the branch into to main.

AND I deleted the branch feature/new-content since it merged successfully to the main branch.

This is branchA
